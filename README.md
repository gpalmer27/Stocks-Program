# Stocks-Program
As part of my Object-Oriented Design course, I worked with a partner to develop a stock simulation in Java. In our program, the user can choose between viewing a text-based interface or a graphical interface. In both the text version and the GUI version, the user can create a portfolio of stocks, and in each portfolio, they can add and remove stocks (simulating the purchasing and selling of stocks). Furthermore, the user can see the contents of their portfolio and the value of that portfolio on a specified date. The text-based version also provides the user with more options, including viewing both the average performance of a specified stock and a bar chart of a stock's performance over time.

By instructor policy, source code can be accessed only by request.
